# Survey of R&D Expenditure and Personnel

This dataset provides detailed information at the **firm level** regarding research and development (R&D) activities. Firms are further classified according to **size** and **economic activity**, allowing for disaggregated analyses across different sectors and firm scales.

## Structure and Coverage

A notable feature of this dataset is its **panel dimension**, which tracks firms from 2009 to 2023. This longitudinal structure facilitates the study of R&D evolution over time, as well as potential links with firm performance and internationalization trends.

Since 2021, the survey has incorporated a **probabilistic component in firm selection**. Previously, the methodology focused on firms already known to invest in R&D, which may have led to an underestimation of total R&D investment. The probabilistic design aims to correct this bias by including a broader representation of firms.

Consequently, for panel analyses, the **constant component of firms included in the R&D survey from 2021 to 2023** can be observed using the prior methodology, while the probabilistic component provides more representative cross-sectional coverage.

The dataset includes a wide range of variables related to R&D, including personnel, expenditures, and other innovation indicators. In particular, the variable **B2001** reports firms’ export values in thousands of pesos, providing a measure of international engagement at the firm level.

## Limitations

While the dataset offers extensive information on R&D activities, it presents certain limitations:

-   **Lack of product-level export information:** There is no breakdown of the specific products that are exported by each firm.\
-   **No export destination data:** The countries or regions to which the exports are sent are not recorded.\
-   **Panel constraints:** The longitudinal analysis is most reliable for the constant component of firms observed across years; the probabilistic component provides broader but less continuous coverage.

## Notes

-   The combination of firm-level panel data and rich R&D variables makes this dataset a valuable resource for studying innovation dynamics across sectors and over time.\
-   Future work could involve linking this dataset with trade registries or customs data to enrich the information on exported products and destinations.


# National Customs Service: Export Data

The **National Customs Service (Servicio Nacional de Aduanas)** provides a complementary dataset that records **export operations at the product level**, classified according to the **Harmonized System (HS)** of goods. This database contains detailed information on the **type of exported products**, **export destinations**, and **trade flows** aggregated by customs offices and operations.

## Structure and Coverage

Unlike the R&D survey, the customs dataset is **not firm-level**, but rather **transaction-level**. Each observation corresponds to an export operation identified by variables such as:

- **FECHAACEPT:** acceptance date of the export declaration.    
- **PAISDESTINO:** country to which the product is exported.  
- **CODIGOARANCEL:** product classification according to the international Harmonized System.  
- **FOBUS:** export item value (in USD).

This dataset provides **broad coverage across sectors and destinations**, offering a comprehensive picture of Chile’s export activity over time.

## Potential Integration with R&D Data

Although the customs data do not include explicit firm-level identifiers compatible with the R&D survey, an **indirect linkage** can be established through **industry codes**. Specifically, by applying a **correspondence between the Harmonized System (HS) and the ISIC/CIIU Rev.4**, it is possible to map products to their corresponding economic activities.

This mapping enables analyses such as:

-   Estimating **export intensity by industry** and comparing it with firms’ R&D investment patterns.  
-   Studying **sectoral specialization in innovation and exports**, identifying industries with high R&D activity and high export participation.  
-   Exploring **heterogeneity across destinations**, such as whether more technologically intensive sectors export disproportionately to developed economies.

## Complementarity with the R&D Survey

The integration of the **Customs dataset** and the **R&D survey** allows for a richer understanding of the relationship between **innovation and internationalization**. While the R&D survey captures firm-level efforts and resources devoted to innovation, the customs data provide an external validation of market outcomes — namely, **export performance** and **product specialization**.

In this sense, the two datasets are **highly complementary**:

| Aspect | R&D Survey | Customs Data |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Unit of observation** | Firm | Export transaction |
| **Temporal coverage** | 2009–2023 | Continuous (annual) |
| **Focus** | R&D personnel, expenditure, innovation | Products, destinations, trade value |
| **Classification system** | ISIC Rev.4 (CIIU4.CL 2012) | Harmonized System (HS) |
| **Linkage potential** | Via HS–CIIU4 correspondence | Via HS–CIIU4 correspondence |

## Aggregation and Sector-Level Indicators

Given that the customs data are disaggregated by **product and destination**, whereas the R&D survey operates at the **firm level**, the integration requires shifting the analytical focus toward the **sectoral level**.  
This approach involves constructing **aggregated indicators of innovation and productivity** by sector and year, derived from the microdata of the R&D survey.

### Construction of Sectoral Indicators

From the R&D microdata, it is possible to compute, for each sector \( s \) and year \( t \):

-   **Average R&D intensity:**  
    \[
    \text{R&D Intensity}_{s,t} = \frac{\text{Total R&D Expenditure}_{s,t}}{\text{Total Sales}_{s,t}}
    \]

-   **Average productivity indicator:** e.g., value added per employee or total factor productivity proxies aggregated at the sector level.

-   **R&D effort distribution:** proportion of firms performing R&D within each sector.

These indicators summarize the **innovation behavior of firms** within a sector, providing a bridge between firm-level and product-level information.

### Linking with Export Data

By linking each export product (HS code) to its corresponding **CIIU4 industry**, the customs data can be aggregated to the same sectoral level as the constructed R&D indicators.  
This alignment allows for the creation of a **sector–year panel** combining:

-   **Export outcomes:** total export value, product diversification, destination markets.  
-   **Innovation outcomes:** average R&D intensity, share of R&D-performing firms, productivity metrics.

Such an integrated database enables the analysis of how **sectoral R&D investment relates to export performance**, product composition, and destination patterns.

### Analytical Potential

This sector-level integration opens new research possibilities, including:

-   Evaluating the **link between innovation intensity and export competitiveness** across industries.  
-   Identifying **technology-intensive sectors** that drive diversification in export baskets.  
-   Studying the **temporal dynamics of R&D and trade specialization**, capturing how innovation efforts precede or respond to changes in international demand.

## Notes

The inclusion of customs data expands the analytical scope of firm-level research by connecting **innovation behavior** with **export specialization patterns**.  
Through the construction of **sectoral R&D and productivity indicators**, it becomes possible to bridge firm-level innovation measures with product-level trade outcomes, creating a unified view of **Chile’s innovation–export nexus**.
