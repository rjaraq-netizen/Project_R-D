# Survey of R&D Expenditure and Personnel

This dataset provides detailed information at the **firm level** regarding research and development (R&D) activities. Firms are further classified according to **size** and **economic activity**, allowing for disaggregated analyses across different sectors and firm scales.

## Structure and Coverage

A notable feature of this dataset is its **panel dimension**, which tracks firms from 2009 to 2023. This longitudinal structure facilitates the study of R&D evolution over time, as well as potential links with firm performance and internationalization trends.

Since 2021, the survey has incorporated a **probabilistic component in firm selection**. Previously, the methodology focused on firms already known to invest in R&D, which may have led to an underestimation of total R&D investment. The probabilistic design aims to correct this bias by including a broader representation of firms.

Consequently, for panel analyses, the **constant component of firms included in the R&D survey from 2021 to 2023** can be observed using the prior methodology, while the probabilistic component provides more representative cross-sectional coverage.

The dataset includes a wide range of variables related to R&D, including personnel, expenditures, and other innovation indicators. In particular, the variable **B2001** reports firms’ export values in thousands of pesos, providing a measure of international engagement at the firm level.

## Limitations

While the dataset offers extensive information on R&D activities, it presents certain limitations:

-   **Lack of product-level export information:** There is no breakdown of the specific products that are exported by each firm.\
-   **No export destination data:** The countries or regions to which the exports are sent are not recorded.\
-   **Panel constraints:** The longitudinal analysis is most reliable for the constant component of firms observed across years; the probabilistic component provides broader but less continuous coverage.

## Notes

-   The combination of firm-level panel data and rich R&D variables makes this dataset a valuable resource for studying innovation dynamics across sectors and over time.\
-   Future work could involve linking this dataset with trade registries or customs data to enrich the information on exported products and destinations.


# National Customs Service: Export Data

The **National Customs Service (Servicio Nacional de Aduanas)** provides a complementary dataset that records **export operations at the product level**, classified according to the **Harmonized System (HS)** of goods. This database contains detailed information on the **type of exported products**, **export destinations**, and **trade flows** aggregated by customs offices and operations.

## Structure and Coverage

Unlike the R&D survey, the customs dataset is **not firm-level**, but rather **transaction-level**. Each observation corresponds to an export operation identified by variables such as:

- **FECHAACEPT:** acceptance date of the export declaration.  
- **CODIGORUTEXPORTADORPPAL:** identifier of the main exporter.  
- **ADUANA:** customs office responsible for processing the operation.  
- **PAÍS DESTINO:** country to which the product is exported.  
- **CÓDIGO SA (Sistema Armonizado):** product classification according to the international Harmonized System.  
- **VALOR FOB:** export value (in USD).

This dataset provides **broad coverage across sectors and destinations**, offering a comprehensive picture of Chile’s export activity over time.

## Potential Integration with R&D Data

Although the customs data do not include explicit firm-level identifiers compatible with the R&D survey, an **indirect linkage** can be established through **industry codes**. Specifically, by applying a **correspondence between the Harmonized System (HS) and the ISIC/CIIU Rev.4**, it is possible to map products to their corresponding economic activities.

This mapping enables analyses such as:

-   Estimating **export intensity by industry** and comparing it with firms’ R&D investment patterns.  
-   Studying **sectoral specialization in innovation and exports**, identifying industries with high R&D activity and high export participation.  
-   Exploring **heterogeneity across destinations**, such as whether more technologically intensive sectors export disproportionately to developed economies.

## Complementarity with the R&D Survey

The integration of the **Customs dataset** and the **R&D survey** allows for a richer understanding of the relationship between **innovation and internationalization**. While the R&D survey captures firm-level efforts and resources devoted to innovation, the customs data provide an external validation of market outcomes — namely, **export performance** and **product specialization**.

In this sense, the two datasets are **highly complementary**:

| Aspect | R&D Survey | Customs Data |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Unit of observation** | Firm | Export transaction |
| **Temporal coverage** | 2009–2023 | Continuous (annual) |
| **Focus** | R&D personnel, expenditure, innovation | Products, destinations, trade value |
| **Classification system** | ISIC Rev.4 (CIIU4.CL 2012) | Harmonized System (HS) |
| **Linkage potential** | Via HS–CIIU4 correspondence | Via HS–CIIU4 correspondence |

## Notes

The inclusion of customs data expands the analytical scope of firm-level research by connecting **innovation behavior** with **export specialization patterns**. Future steps may involve constructing an **industry-level panel** combining both data sources, leveraging the **HS–CIIU4 mapping** to analyze R&D–trade interactions across time and sectors.
